First task: Initialization

It initializes processedArray, a variable, to be an empty array after declaring it. The processed elements will eventually be stored in this array.

Going through the Input Array Iteratively:

The function iterates over each element (num) in the input array arr using a for...of loop.

Using Even/Odd to Process Elements:

The loop determines whether the modulo operator (%) is even being used by the current element (num).
In the event that the element is even (num % 2 === 0), the squared value is pushed into the processedArray and the element is squared using the exponentiation operator ().
The element is multiplied by 3 (num \* 3) and pushed into the processedArray if the element is odd (else block).

The Processed Array is returned:

After iterating through all elements, the function returns the processedArray containing the squares of even numbers and triplets of odd numbers from the original array

Task 2:
Initialization:

It declares a constant variable named formattedStrings and initializes it as an empty array. This array will hold the formatted strings after processing.

Iterating through Elements:

The function uses a for loop to iterate over the elements in the Strings array. The loop variable i acts as an index to access corresponding elements in both arrays.

Extracting String and Number:

Inside the loop, it extracts the current string element from the Strings array using the index i and stores it in the variable string.
It also extracts the corresponding number element from the Numbers array using the same index i and stores it in the variable number.

Conditional Formatting based on Number:

The function checks if the current number (number) is even using the modulo operator (%).
If the number is even (number % 2 === 0):
It converts the string to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method and pushes the uppercase string into the formattedStrings array.
If the number is odd (else block):
It converts the string to lowercase using the toLowerCase() method and pushes the lowercase string into the formattedStrings array.

Returning the Formatted Strings:

After iterating through all elements, the function returns the formattedStrings array. This array now contains the strings from the original Strings array, but formatted according to the corresponding numbers in the Numbers array (uppercase for even numbers, lowercase for odd numbers).

Task 3:
Initialization:

It declares a constant variable named userProfiles and initializes it as an empty array. This array will eventually hold the user profile objects.
It declares a variable named id and initializes it to 1. This variable will be used to assign unique IDs to each user profile.

Iterating through Names and Modified Names:

The function uses a for loop to iterate over the elements in both the names and modifiedNames arrays simultaneously. The loop variable i acts as an index to access corresponding elements in both arrays.

Extracting Names:

Inside the loop, it extracts the current original name from the names array using the index i and stores it in the variable originalName.
It also extracts the corresponding modified name from the modifiedNames array using the same index i and stores it in the variable modifiedName.

Creating User Profile Objects:

The function creates a new user profile object using object literal notation.
The object properties include:
originalName: The original name extracted from the names array.
modifiedName: The modified name extracted from the modifiedNames array.
id: The unique ID for the user profile, retrieved from the id variable.
It then uses the push method to add this user profile object to the userProfiles array.

Incrementing ID:

After creating the user profile object, the function increments the id variable by 1 to ensure unique IDs for each user.

Returning User Profiles:

After iterating through all names and creating corresponding user profiles, the function returns the userProfiles array. This array now contains objects with information about each user, including their original name, modified name, and unique ID
